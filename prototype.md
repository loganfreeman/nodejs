The `__proto__` property of Object.prototype is an accessor property (a getter function and a setter function) that exposes the internal [[Prototype]] (either an object or null) of the object through which it is accessed.

The use of __proto__ is controversial, and has been discouraged. It was never originally included in the EcmaScript language spec, but modern browsers decided to implement it anyway. Only recently, the __proto__ property has been standardized in the ECMAScript 2015 language specification for web browsers to ensure compatibility, so will be supported into the future. It is deprecated in favor of Object.getPrototypeOf/Reflect.getPrototypeOf and Object.setPrototypeOf/Reflect.setPrototypeOf (though still, setting the [[Prototype]] of an object is a slow operation that should be avoided if performance is a concern).

The __proto__ property can also be used in an object literal definition to set the object [[Prototype]] on creation, as an alternative to Object.create(). See: object initializer / literal syntax.
